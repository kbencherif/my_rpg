Jhon The Farmer  :  Oh god ! A Monster ! Please don't kill me !!! Wait why aren't you attacking me ..?%%I saw you running away from monsters do they try to kill you ? You aren't equipped at all that's why you ran away,%%a normal monster won't do that. I guess you should talk to the chief. Hes in the house a bit higher. Tell him I sent you.%%Maybe he'll help you finding what you want. If you do so, I'll give you something that can cure anything not too serious.
Jhon The Farmer  :  Wow, he didn't kill you ? Take this I always keep my promises !
Jhon The Farmer  :  You should go in chief house before someone else get in here and attack you.
Jhon The Farmer  :  I never saw a monster that is nice, everyone talk about your story some talk about a prophecy.
